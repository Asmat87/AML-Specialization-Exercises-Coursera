# AML-Specialization-Exercises-Coursera
Solved programming exercises from the Advanced Machine Learning specialization by National Research University on Coursera.

**NOTE**: For reference purpose only. Use only if you get stuck really bad. Try to do mostly by yourself, it helps in the long run ;-).
